# PaymentGatewayPlugin
Author - Jaskirat Singh

This is a Payment Gateway plugin used to make payments through PayU and it works successfully in core PHP and any framework based on PHP using Object Oriented Approach. Our vision is to extend this for every possible payment gateway.

SETUP GUIDE:

1.  Go to payu official site and register yourself and get MERCHANT_KEY & SALT_ID for integrating your site with PayU payment gateway.
2.  Download zip file and extract the same in the root location of your server. For eg:- directory structure looks like http://localhost/PaymentGatewayPlugin/client.php
3.  Open and edit file named 'client.php' and fill in information of your account created in PayU.
4.  Run client.php!
5.  That's it you have successfully integrated with PayU.
